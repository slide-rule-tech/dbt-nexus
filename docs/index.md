# dbt-nexus Documentation

Welcome to the **dbt-nexus** package documentation! This package provides a
standardized, source-agnostic solution for building unified customer data
platforms with powerful identity resolution and state management capabilities.

## What is dbt-nexus?

dbt-nexus is a dbt package that helps you:

- **üîó Resolve identities** across multiple data sources and systems
- **üìä Track events** with standardized event logging
- **üë• Manage entities** including persons, groups, and their relationships
- **üè∑Ô∏è Handle states** with timeline-based state management
- **‚ö° Scale efficiently** with incremental processing and optimized queries

## Quick Start

Get up and running with dbt-nexus in minutes:

```yaml
# packages.yml
packages:
  - local: path/to/dbt-nexus
```

```bash
dbt deps
```

[‚Üí Follow the complete installation guide](getting-started/installation.md)

## Core Features

### üîç Identity Resolution

Automatically resolve and deduplicate entities across data sources using
configurable matching rules and recursive algorithms.

### üìã Event Logging

Standardized event, identifier, and trait tracking with support for real-time
and batch processing.

### üè∑Ô∏è State Management

The package follows a layered architecture:

1. **Source Adapters**: Transform your data into standardized formats
2. **Event Log Layer**: Core event, identifier, and trait models
3. **Identity Resolution**: Advanced algorithms for entity deduplication
4. **State Management**: Timeline-based state tracking and derived states
5. **Final Tables**: Production-ready, resolved entity tables
