# dbt-nexus Documentation

Welcome to the **dbt-nexus** package documentation! This package provides a
standardized, source-agnostic solution for building unified customer data
platforms with powerful identity resolution and state management capabilities.

## What is dbt-nexus?

dbt-nexus is a way of structuring all company data in your data warehouse so
it's **operationally** useful, not just good for dashboards. It's designed to
help you actually close sales, speed up customer support, and reduce churn.

Specifically, it's a dbt package that lets data engineers quickly merge and
organize **any** data source into a combined view of **people**, **companies**,
and **events** - creating a complete timeline of everything you know about your
customers.

dbt-nexus helps you:

- **üîó Resolve identities** across multiple data sources and systems
- **üìä Track events** with standardized event logging that creates actionable
  timelines
- **üë• Manage entities** including persons, groups, and their relationships
- **üè∑Ô∏è Handle states** with timeline-based state management
- **‚ö° Scale efficiently** with incremental processing and optimized queries
- **üéØ Drive operations** - support teams, sales teams, and AI tools get
  complete customer context
