All notable changes to the dbt-nexus package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Comprehensive documentation with MkDocs
- LLM-friendly context pack for AI assistance
- State management with derived states
- Cross-database compatibility (Snowflake/BigQuery)
- Edge deduplication in identity resolution algorithm
- Complete identity resolution algorithm documentation with real performance
  metrics
- Source identifier formatting documentation with `unpivot_identifiers` macro
  examples
- Dynamic column handling in `nexus_events` with optional field support
- Cross-database column name case compatibility (Snowflake uppercase vs others
  lowercase)
- Strong typing for all event columns with automatic NULL handling for missing
  fields

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Identity resolution performance dramatically improved through
  edge deduplication
- `create_identifier_edges` macro now deduplicates edges using surrogate keys
  for massive performance gains
- Improved recursive CTE performance limits
- Enhanced incremental model strategies
- Identity resolution now scales linearly with unique entities rather than total
  events
- `nexus_events` model now uses dynamic column detection and strong typing
- Event column types now enforced: `value`/`significance` as FLOAT, timestamps
  as TIMESTAMP, strings as VARCHAR

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Identity resolution performance bottleneck causing 10+ minute
  execution times
- Memory issues with large identity resolution datasets
- Edge explosion problem in high-frequency entity scenarios (26,000+ events per
  entity)
- Column type inconsistencies in `nexus_events` union operations
- Cross-database column name case sensitivity issues in
  `dbt_utils.union_relations`
- Missing optional columns now properly handled with typed NULL values

### Performance Improvements

- Identity resolution edge creation: Hours ‚Üí 3-5 seconds
- Recursive resolution: 12+ minutes ‚Üí 4-5 seconds
- Edge reduction: 1.8M duplicate edges ‚Üí 790 unique edges (99.96% reduction)
- Memory usage: Linear scaling vs quadratic explosion

### Technical Details

**Edge Deduplication Algorithm**:

- Added surrogate key-based deduplication in `create_identifier_edges` macro
- Uses `generate_surrogate_key([type_a, value_a, type_b, value_b])` for
  uniqueness
- Eliminates cartesian product explosion in high-frequency entity scenarios
- Preserves all semantic relationships while removing redundant processing

**Dynamic Column Handling in nexus_events**:

- Compile-time column detection using `adapter.get_columns_in_relation()`
- Cross-database column name case handling (Snowflake uppercase vs others
  lowercase)
- Automatic column override generation with proper dbt type functions
- Missing columns automatically added as typed NULL values
- Supports optional schema fields: `significance`, `source_table`, `synced_at`

**Column Type Enforcement**:

- `value`, `significance`: `dbt.type_float()` (cross-database FLOAT)
- `occurred_at`, `synced_at`: `dbt.type_timestamp()` (cross-database TIMESTAMP)
- All other fields: `dbt.type_string()` (cross-database VARCHAR/TEXT)

**Impact**:

- Entities with 26,000+ events previously created 676M+ duplicate edges
- Now creates exactly 1 edge per unique identifier relationship
- Enables identity resolution on datasets with millions of events per entity
- Event model now works consistently across Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL,
  etc.
- Flexible schema handling allows source tables with varying column sets

**Backward Compatibility**:

- No changes required to existing source models
- All `*_person_identifiers`, `*_group_identifiers` tables work unchanged
- Event participation and final entity tables maintain identical output schema
- Existing `*_events` models work unchanged, missing columns auto-filled with
  NULL
