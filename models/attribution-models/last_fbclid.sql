{#
This model finds the last fbclid for each batch by looking back through 
the person's touchpoint history. For each batch, it identifies the most 
recent previous batch (for the same person) that contains an fbclid value.

The approach uses a window function to find the most recent previous batch with fbclid
for each person, then assigns that fbclid to all subsequent batches until 
a new fbclid is encountered.
